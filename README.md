# igniteui-angular-i18n

> Note: The source for the package has been moved under [Ignite UI for Angular](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular) monorepo, under [igniteui-angular-i18n](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/tree/master/projects/igniteui-angular-i18n) project.

## Purpose

This respository stores resource strings for the Ignite UI for Angular `i18n`. The English resource strings and the interfaces for each localizable component's `resourceStrings` property are stored in the [Ignite UI for Angular](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular) repository. The interfaces can be used as a schema for creating custom resource strings.

## File Usage

An npm package will be produced and it could be referenced alongside with the igniteui-angular in the clients' projects.

## Branches

The branching scheme must follow the [Ignite UI for Angular](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular) branching. In order to get the correct resource strings for `igniteui-angular` package the `igniteui-angular-i18n` package should have the latest corresponding major version in the clients' projects. For example if `igniteui-angular` has version `7.2.1` the `igniteui-angular-i18n` should have version `^7.2.0`.
