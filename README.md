# igniteui-angular-i18n

## Purpose

This respository stores the Japanese and Korean resource strings for the Ignite UI for Angular `i18n`. The English resource strings are stored in the [Ignite UI for Angular](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular) repository. It also contains the interfaces for each localizable component's `resourceStrings` property. They can be used as a schema for creating custom resource strings.

## File Usage

An npm package will be produced and it will be referenced in the Ignite UI for Angular product.

## Branches

The branching scheme must follow the [Ignite UI for Angular](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular) branching.  Work in the master branch, and when we are getting ready for a release, create a versioned branch (ex. 6.2.x). This will allow the build to get the correct version of the files.
